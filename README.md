# Data_Science_Projects
**Milk Yield Prediction**
Built different Regression models to solve the problem. Explored different data analysis and visualization techniques to understand the data and performed manipulations on it to improve on the accuracy of 
predictions of models build

**Length of Stay prediction(Healthcare Management)**
Built different classification and deep learning algorithms to build different models where each model had different preprocessing techniques attempting to make the model understand the innate patterns present in the dataset. Used different approaches to explain the variables present in the data and tried building iterative models based on my understanding improving the performances of models gradually

**Women Clothing Review Analysis & Breast Cancer Image classification**
Explored different Natural Language processing techniques to manipulate the text data present in the dataset and build different deep learning algorithms to create predictive models that classified the sentiment of the text close to accurate in Women Clothing Review analysis dataset. In Breast cancer image classification project used different image augmentation techniques to capturing different dimension of the data and build a CNN algorithm to create a predictive model that would predict whether the given scan image indicates that the patient has breast cancer or not

**Physical activity prediction**
Used different visualization and preprocessing techniques to understand the patterns and behaviors of each sensors measuring each body parts and how they affect different activities and build a classification and deep learning model that would predict the type of activity based on the measurements given

**Online customer purchasing intent**
Implemented different unsupervised learning techniques to create clusters and validating the different groups created by the algorithms. Used the output label given in the dataset as the test data and created different classification model to compare the labels created by the clustering algorithms and the output label.

**Spotify dataset analysis**
Analysed different aspect such as danceability of around 1000 songs composed by various artists by extracting the data required to infer information about the dataset using SQL
