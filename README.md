1. Healthcare Management:
   The case study involves predicting the length of stay of a patient based on different variables. Performed feature engineering and built several models predominantly
   using Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms.

2. Women's Clothing Review Sentiment Prediction:
   Based on the reviews given we need to predict whether the customer recommends the product or not. Performed various Natural Language processing techniques to vectorize text data
   and build Machine learning and deep learning models to predict the sentiment of the customer.

3. Online Customer Purchasing Intent:
   Contains data about customers' usage of e-commerce sites and based on that we can see whether the customer will buy from the store or not. Used unsupervised learning to get clusters
   from the data and used that label to build a model and compared that with the original label given with the dataset which states whether the customer will make the purchase or not.

4. Potato Disease classification
   Using the Convolution Neural Network algorithm built a model that would classify the type of disease a potato leaf has based on the images given.
   
5. Reddit Chatbot
   Built a chatbot using the capabilities of Large Language models, Hugging face interface, and langchain framework on custom data from data science and machine learning threads 
   extracted from Reddit API.
