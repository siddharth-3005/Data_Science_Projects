# Data_Science_Projects
1. Healthcare Management:
   The case study involves predicting the length of stay of a patient based on different variables. Performed feature engineering and build several model predominantly
   using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms.

2. Physical Activity Prediction:
   Dataset involves predicting the type of activity the user has engaged in based on several measurements taken from different sensors in a smart watch.
   Build Decision Tree models after balancing the target variable, transforming and performing feature engineering. physical_activity_before_pruning notebook contains model build using max depth 10
   and physical_activity_final notebook contains model build using max depth of 15

3. Milk Yield Prediction:
   This project involves predicting the milk yield of the cow based on different parameters. Three different approaches were used. First we imputed the null values by median and performed
   outlier treatment and build models. Next we imputed the null values by KNN imputer, performed power transformer on the entire dataset before train test split and build model. Last
   we used the median imputed dataset and performed power transformer after train test split and build model.
   Predominantly used Linear regression algorithm to build models

4. Women Clothing Review Sentiment Prediction:
   Based on the reviews given we need to predict whether the customer recommends the product or not. Performed various Natural Language processing techniques to vectorize text data
   and build Machine learning and deep learning models to predict the sentiment of the customer.

5. Spotify SQL analysis:
   Used SQL to extract data and analyzed the different components of several songs from the Spotify dataset containing different parameters of around 1000 songs.

6. Online Customer Purchasing Intent:
   Contains data about customers usage of ecommerce site and based on that we can see whether the customer will buy from the store or not. Used unsupervised learning to get clusters
   from the data and used that label to build a model and compared that with the original label given with the dataset which states whether the customer will make the purchase or not.
