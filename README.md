# Data_Science_Projects
1. Healthcare Management:
   The case study involves predicting the length of stay of a patient based on different variables. Performed feature engineering and built several models predominantly
   using Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms.

2. Physical Activity Prediction:
   Dataset involves predicting the type of activity the user has engaged in based on several measurements taken from different sensors in a smartwatch.
   Build Decision Tree models after balancing the target variable, transforming, and performing feature engineering. physical_activity_before_pruning notebook contains a model built using 
   max depth 10
   and physical_activity_final notebook contains model build using a max depth of 15

3. Milk Yield Prediction:
   This project involves predicting the milk yield of the cow based on different parameters. Three different approaches were used. First, we imputed the null values by median and 
   performed
   outlier treatment and built models. Next, we imputed the null values by KNN imputer and performed power transformer on the entire dataset before training test split and building the model. 
   Last
   we used the median imputed dataset and performed power transformer after train test split and build model.
   Predominantly used Linear regression algorithm to build models

4. Women's Clothing Review Sentiment Prediction:
   Based on the reviews given we need to predict whether the customer recommends the product or not. Performed various Natural Language processing techniques to vectorize text data
   and build Machine learning and deep learning models to predict the sentiment of the customer.

5. Spotify SQL analysis:
   Used SQL to extract data and analyze the different components of several songs from the Spotify dataset containing different parameters of around 1000 songs.

6. Online Customer Purchasing Intent:
   Contains data about customers' usage of e-commerce sites and based on that we can see whether the customer will buy from the store or not. Used unsupervised learning to get clusters
   from the data and used that label to build a model and compared that with the original label given with the dataset which states whether the customer will make the purchase or not.

7. Call Centre data analysis PowerBI dashboard
   A Power BI dashboard for a telecom company to understand the various aspects of customer satisfaction based on call duration, rating, complaint type, and so on.

8. Potato Disease classification
   Using the Convolution Neural Network algorithm built a model that would classify the type of disease a potato leaf has based on the images given.
   
9. Reddit Chatbot
   Built a chatbot using the capabilities of Large Language models, Hugging face interface, and langchain framework on custom data from data science and machine learning threads 
   extracted from Reddit API.

10. Stroke prediction Streamlit web app
    Built a streamlit web app to display the model prediction in the form of a web app where users can give inputs and the app will give a prediction based on the input. Built this to see how to deploy an ML model into an app and how it works in action.
